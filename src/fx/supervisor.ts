 * Default exponential backoff strategy used by {@link supervise}.

 * Uses exponential backoff with base 2: 20ms, 40ms, 80ms, ... up to ~10 seconds.

 *
 * @param attempt - Current attempt count (1-based).
 * @param max - Maximum attempts before giving up (default: 10).
 * @returns Milliseconds to wait before next attempt, or negative to stop.
 *
 * @example Custom max attempts
 * ```ts
 * const backoff = (attempt: number) => superviseBackoff(attempt, 5);
 * const supervised = supervise(myOperation, backoff);

/**
 * Create a supervised operation that restarts on failure with backoff.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Supervisor tasks monitor operations and manage their health. When the
 * supervised operation fails, the supervisor waits according to the backoff
 * strategy before restarting it. This pattern is inspired by Erlang's
 * supervisor trees.
 *
 * On failure, an action is emitted with the error details, useful for
 * debugging and monitoring.
 *
 * @typeParam T - The return type of the operation.
 * @typeParam TArgs - Argument types for the operation.
 * @param op - Operation factory to supervise.
 * @param backoff - Backoff function returning milliseconds to wait, or negative to stop.
 *   Defaults to {@link superviseBackoff}.
 * @returns An operation factory that supervises the original operation.
 *
 * @see {@link superviseBackoff} for the default backoff strategy.
 * @see {@link keepAlive} for supervising multiple operations.
 * @see {@link https://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/des_princ | Erlang supervisors}
 *
 * @example Basic supervision
 * ```ts
 * import { supervise } from 'starfx';
 *
 * function* unstableTask() {
 *   // We want this to run forever, restarting on failure
 *   // but it may fail intermittently
 * }
 *
 * const supervised = supervise(unstableTask);
 * yield* supervised(); // Automatically restarts on failure
 * ```
 *
 * @example Custom backoff
 * ```ts
 * // Linear backoff: 1s, 2s, 3s, ...
 * const linearBackoff = (attempt: number) =>
 *   attempt > 5 ? -1 : attempt * 1000;
 *
 * const supervised = supervise(myTask, linearBackoff);
