/**
 * The goal of `parallel` is to make it easier to cooridnate multiple async
 * operations in parallel, with different ways to receive completed tasks.
 *
 * All tasks are called with {@link fx.safe} which means they will never
 * throw an exception.  Instead all tasks will return a Result object that
 * the end development must evaluate in order to grab the value.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { parallel } from "starfx";
 *
 * function* run() {
 *  const task = yield* parallel([job1, job2]);
 *  // wait for all tasks to complete before moving to next yield point
 *  const results = yield* task;
 *  // job1 = results[0];
 *  // job2 = results[1];
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Instead of waiting for all tasks to complete, we can instead loop over
 * tasks as they arrive:
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * function* run() {
 *  const task = yield* parallel([job1, job2]);
 *  for (const job of yield* each(task.immediate)) {
 *    // job2 completes first then it will be first in list
 *    console.log(job);
 *    yield* each.next();
 *  }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Or we can instead loop over tasks in order of the array provided to
 * parallel:
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * function* run() {
 *  const task = yield* parallel([job1, job2]);
 *  for (const job of yield* each(task.sequence)) {
 *    // job1 then job2 will be returned regardless of when the jobs
 *    // complete
 *    console.log(job);
 *    yield* each.next();
 *  }
 * }
 * ```
