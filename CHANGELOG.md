# Changelog

## \[0.16.1]

### Dependencies

- [`a06e93c`](https://github.com/fxforge/starfx/commit/a06e93c85507392228904f4e9b3640d0ab69e56f) ([#88](https://github.com/fxforge/starfx/pull/88) by [@jbolda](https://github.com/fxforge/starfx/../../jbolda)) The `createScope` return signature change slightly in the upcoming version of `effection`. Adjusting preemptively for future compatibility.

## \[0.16.0]

- Update to `effection` v4.
- `thunk.manage()` API for managing `effecton` resources
- filled out JSDocs for better IDE help

### Breaking Changes

- The update to `effection` v4 may bring breaking changes depending on how deeply your effects were built on v3 semantics. See the migration blog post for `effection`.
- removed deprecated `bootup` alias from thunk/query APIs. Use `register()` instead.
- `Instruction` is no longer re-exported from `starfx`; import it directly from `effection`.
